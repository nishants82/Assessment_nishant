Change Management and Release Management are different but related functions within organizations. 
At a high level, Change activities relate to the process of requesting changes, assessing changes,
authorizing changes and reviewing changes. Release activities include planning, designing, configuration,
rollout planning, testing communication and deployment. The Release Management function provides the schedule and execution whilst 
the Change Approval Board authorizes the change to controlled environments.
